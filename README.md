## 📐 Key DAX Measures
```DAX
Total Spend = SUM(Campaigns[Spend])
Total Revenue = SUM(Campaigns[Revenue])
Total Impressions = SUM(Campaigns[Impressions])
Total Clicks = SUM(Campaigns[Clicks])
Total Conversions = SUM(Campaigns[Conversions])

CTR (%) = DIVIDE([Total Clicks], [Total Impressions]) * 100
ROI (%) = DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - [Total Spend], [Total Spend]) * 100
